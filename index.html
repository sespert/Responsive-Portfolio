            <p>Iâ€™m a very motivated Front-End Developer with strong tech skills and detailed oriented personality. </p>
            <p>I've acquired HTML/CSS and JavaScript skills at the University of Miami Coding Bootcamp and learned Java and C++ 
            at Miami Dade College. </p>
            <p>I also have a PhD in Biology with a background in molecular biology, genetics and phylogenetics. 
                I've worked at University of Buenos Aires in Argentina, and at the Miller School of Medicine (UM) as a postdoctoral researcher in the Microbiology
                Department.</p>
            <p>I've enjoyed the experience of teaching several undergraduate and graduate classes. Moreover, this allowed me 
                to improve my communication skills. </p>
            <p>After a few years of full dedication to my children, I'm ready to rejoin the workforce with more passion
                than ever.</p>
            <p>I would describe myself to be very effective and having an efficient mind, a passion of helping others, so I can be a great asset 
            in any web development project. </p>
